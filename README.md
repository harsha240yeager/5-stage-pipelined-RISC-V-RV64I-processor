# 5-stage-pipelined-RISC-V-RV64I-processor
This repository contains a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor implementing the RV64I base ISA with support for the Zba address-generation extension (SH1ADD, SH2ADD, SH3ADD). The project was developed as part of the LFX Mentorship Coding Challenge and focuses on pipeline design, hazard handling, and RTL verification using SystemVerilog.
